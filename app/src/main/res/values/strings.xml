To set up this app you need to choose files that should be deleted, then activate files deletion and set up Duress app. Enter following parameters in Duress:<p>action: com.android.syrenapass.action.TRIGGER</p><p>receiver: com.android.syrenapass/.presentation.services.DuressListener</p><p>key: password</p><p>value: <strong>your password from this app</strong><p>You can also enable logs and test app on some mock data.</p>]]></string>
